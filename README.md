- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dmoress and I am new to GitHub.
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Development, Networking and building and developing a personal AI using Gen AI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Gen AI and how to develop an AI to cater to my preferences using a database I am building to enable my AI to answer specific queries.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate once I have learnt more about my interests, for now i am going to expand my knowledge and experiment (hopefully with some success!!!) until the time comes when I will be confident enough to join with others.
- 📫 How to reach me IF anyone really does want to reach me (I don't know why anyone would yet as I am a newb!!!) they can shoot me an email at Dmoress-JoNoel@outlook.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: They/Them
- ⚡ Fun fact: Let me get back to you...
